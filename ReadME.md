## Blood Pressure Reports
Every report has same abstract format:
  + input 
  + etl process
  + output
### input
Supplies the blood pressure readings in an CSV formated file expected by the report's stated input.
  + The CSV formated input file must be saved to the "input" subdirectory of the specific report's parent directory.
  + The file must be named BPdata.csv
### etl process
The transform process that converts the BPData into a form needed by either the next step in the etl process or the desired final output format.  For example, the report [Stacked Left Systolic Blood Pressure Percentages by Week](#stacked-left-systoli-blood-pressure-percentages-by-week) converts its BPdata.csv file into an output CSV file that can easily be consumed by Google Sheet's Graph tool to easily generate a stacked bar chart.
The etl process employs SQL to program its transforms.  Use SQL VIEWs to create a layered set of transforms to encode the desired conversion from input to output.  One could also create a transform pipeline by feeding the
output of one etl process to into the input of another one but this level of complexity is probably unnecessary. 
### output
The report generated by appling the etl process to the report's inputs.

potentially requires its own input data format. Therefore, each However interface Blood pressure readings must conform to the following CSV format:
|   Date   |  Time  |LeftSystolic|LeftDiastolic|Pulse |
|MM/DD/YYYY|HH:MM:SS|-----------------------------------------------------------
### Stacked Left Systolic Blood Pressure Percentages by Week
Show the percentage of various category

|   Date   |  Time  |LeftSystolic|LeftDiastolic|Pulse |

|MM/DD/YYYY|HH:MM:SS|-----------------------------------------------------------
